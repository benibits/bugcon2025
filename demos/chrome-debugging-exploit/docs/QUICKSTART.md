# Quick Start Guide - Chrome Remote Debugging PoC

## Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Chrome with Debugging Enabled

**On Windows (Use the provided batch file - RECOMMENDED):**
```cmd
start_chrome_debug.bat
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt - Manual):**
```cmd
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\temp\chrome-debug" --remote-allow-origins=*
```

**On Windows (PowerShell - Manual):**
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\temp\chrome-debug" --remote-allow-origins=*
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `--user-data-dir` flag creates a separate Chrome profile for debugging
- This prevents conflicts with your existing Chrome instance
- You can run both your normal Chrome AND the debugging instance simultaneously
- The `--remote-allow-origins=*` flag is **REQUIRED** for the WebSocket connection to work (Chrome security feature)

### 3. Open Some Test Tabs

In the debugging Chrome instance, open a few tabs:
- https://github.com (to test cookie extraction)
- https://www.reddit.com (another site with cookies)
- Any site where you're logged in

### 4. Run the Exploit

```bash
python chrome_hijack_basic.py
```

## What You Should See

If everything works, you'll see:
1. Chrome version and debugging info
2. List of all open tabs
3. Extracted cookies from the selected tab
4. A screenshot saved to `hijacked_screenshot.png`
5. localStorage data from the page

## Troubleshooting

### "No debugging port found"
- Make sure Chrome is running with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag
- Check that nothing else is using port 9222
- Try accessing http://localhost:9222/json in your browser - you should see JSON data

### "No targets found"
- Open some tabs in the debugging Chrome instance
- Make sure the tabs are loading actual websites (not chrome:// pages)

### "Failed to connect"
- The target might have closed
- Try running the script again
- Check that Chrome is still running

### "Module not found" errors
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Make sure you're using the correct Python environment

## Testing Tips

1. **Test with Different Sites:**
   - Try banks, social media, crypto exchanges
   - See what sensitive data is exposed

2. **Test Session Hijacking:**
   - Extract cookies from a site where you're logged in
   - Use those cookies in another browser
   - Verify you can access the account

3. **Test the Screenshot:**
   - Open a tab with sensitive information
   - Run the script
   - Check that `hijacked_screenshot.png` captured it

## Blue Team - Detection

Want to see how defenders detect this attack?

```bash
python chrome_debug_detector.py
```

This will scan for:
- ✅ Open debugging ports (9222-9225)
- ✅ Chrome processes with debug flags
- ✅ Active debug connections
- ✅ Debug profile directories
- ✅ Risk assessment and remediation steps

## 🎬 Quick Demo Script

**Step 1: Start Chrome (10 seconds)**
```cmd
start_chrome_debug.bat
```
Wait for Chrome to open.

**Step 2: Open Test Tabs (20 seconds)**
In the debug Chrome window, open:
- https://github.com
- https://reddit.com
- Any other interesting site

**Step 3: Run the Exploit (30 seconds)**
```cmd
python chrome_hijack_basic.py
```

**Step 4: Show the Results**
- Point out the 26+ cookies extracted
- Show the session tokens (loid, csrf_token, etc.)
- Open `hijacked_screenshot.png` to show visual proof
- Explain the impact (session hijacking, account takeover)

**Total Demo Time: ~60 seconds** ⏱️
